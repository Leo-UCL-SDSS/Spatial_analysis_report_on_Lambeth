## Executive summary

The study finds a significant clustering pattern of high unemployment in north-east Lambeth, while low unemployment clusters exist in western Lambeth. The negative correlation between educational attainment (with a higher rank indicating less educated) and the unemployment rate is stronger in mid-Lambeth, coupled with a slight decline in absolute coefficient in southern areas. Therefore, to tackle the unemployment issue, it is recommended that councils target specific economic and educational policies in south-west and north-west areas of the borough. Applicable policies could include reduced educational expenditure and enhanced educational resources, which will incentivise citizens to access education.  

## The dataset:

This report focuses on the unemployment distribution in Lambeth using 2021 census data. Unemployment (Y) is defined by metadata.csv as ‘being economically active but unemployed’, and the data has been filtered to be Lambeth-specific. Initial unemployment distribution is displayed in the study, and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) are used for determining clustering patterns, exploring whether unemployment is spatially relevant. 
Given that people with poor educational qualifications are more likely to experience unemployment in their adulthood (Barry, 2019), this report also aims to discuss the correlation between unemployment rate (Y) and educational attainment. Education and Skill Deprivation (X) is selected from IMD2019 data, assessing the qualifications attained by under-18s and adults.  As the scores of education attainments do not directly relate to the proportion of the population experiencing deprivation, rank is used as the indicator of education, with a higher rank meaning more educationally deprived. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is adopted to analyse the local relationship between X and Y.  Initial education attainments distribution and its coefficient map are also included, showing the strength of the correlation across Lambeth.

```
The unemployment rate ranges from 1.52% to 9.44% and is divided into five groups, with the darkest red representing unemployment rates of 6.47% to 9.44%, which signify relatively severe unemployment status. Conversely, the lightest red represents unemployment rates of 1.52% to 2.90%, highlighting relatively lower unemployment. The histogram shows a roughly normal distribution of unemployment rates, while north-east regions exhibit notable higher unemployment rates of over 5.08%, and the overall margins of Lambeth show relevant lower unemployment rates up to 3.94%.

The unemployment rate ranges from 1.52% to 9.44% and is divided into five groups, with the darkest red representing unemployment rates of 6.47% to 9.44%, which signify relatively severe unemployment status. Conversely, the lightest red represents unemployment rates of 1.52% to 2.90%, highlighting relatively lower unemployment. The histogram shows a roughly normal distribution of unemployment rates, while north-east regions exhibit notable higher unemployment rates of over 5.08%, and the overall margins of Lambeth show relevant lower unemployment rates up to 3.94%. 

High-High cluster, indicated by dark red, represents areas with high unemployment that are geographically concentrated and adjacent. In the map, north-east Lambeth displays prevalent high-high clusters, while some areas in mid-Lambeth show the same characteristics, corresponding to the previous unemployment distribution map. Conversely, low-low clusters are highlighted in dark blue, representing closely located low unemployment areas. On the map, western Lambeth exhibits significant low-low areas. 

Low-high and high-low clusters represent areas with both low and high unemployment rate that are more difficult to explain. The map shows notable low-high and high-low clusters in north-west and north-east Lambeth, indicated in light blue and light red, signifying a lower unemployed region bounded by higher unemployed areas and vice versa. The rest of the map is dominated by insignificant clustering, indicating a more randomly dispersed unemployment distribution. 

Therefore, Lambeth Council should target specific policies to tackle those high-unemployment clusters, including per-unit business subsidies or improved transportation, to ensure the area is worth investing in and creating further job opportunities. However, Munyoro (2017) argues that unemployment benefits may lead businesses to be less willing to invest in assisted areas, as there may be fewer skilled workers due to being deskilled or being unemployed for long periods. Thus, he recommends reducing unemployment benefits in order to encourage the unemployed to take low paid jobs.  For low-high and high-low regions, further research should be focused on the characteristics that cause such divergent employment rates in closely related areas.

```

The distribution of education attainments (X) shows that the areas of north-east and northern Lambeth are highly educationally deprived, with most people ranked from 7592nd to 20006th, while south-west and western Lambeth are relatively less deprived, with most people ranked from 20006th to 32259th. This result corresponds to Y output, which indicates a higher unemployment rate in north-east Lambeth. The education coefficient map also demonstrates some significant outputs, with the west-mid-east and upper north regions having a stronger coefficient of -0.017% to -0.015%, meaning that one unit higher in the educational deprived rank is correlated with 0.017% to 0.015% increase in unemployment. Although the strength in the northern and southern regions is slightly weaker, the coefficients are still significant, from -0.015% to - 0.011%. 

This report has demonstrated that in London, particularly Lambeth, high levels of educational deprivation are coupled with high levels of unemployment rates. These findings align with other studies elsewhere, for example, graduates in Paris are more likely to be employed than individuals with educational deprivation (OECD, 2000). The findings relating to Lambeth can be partially explained by the signaling theory that employers see education qualification as an indicator of the accumulation of capital and productivity, and people with lower educational attainment are deemed as unqualified and rejected in job interviews.

In conclusion, northeast Lambeth is determined as highly unemployed and is geographically close to other regions with high unemployment rates. In addition, north-east Lambeth is found to have low education levels, with a strong correlation with its high unemployment rates. Thus, Lambeth Council should focus on this area, invest in its education infrastructure, and create work opportunities, including providing subsidies for local businesses to increase occupations and increase access to devices to enhance individual study efficiency and ensure higher education quality. Further research should investigate the characteristics and causes of eastern Lambeth, where a low-unemployment region is mixed with a high-unemployment region. 

## Technical Appendix

Classification: Quantile and Jenks

In this study, both Quantile and Jenks methods are used to classify different variables. For education ranks with continuous values, quantile classification is adopted to group the values into five equal groups, ensuring the comparison among each group is meaningful without concerning data skewness. For Moran statistics, local R2, and Education coefficient maps, Jenks method is used to highlight the breaks with different groups. Therefore, variance within classes is minimized and variance between classes is maximized (Jenks,1967). 


Clustering: Moran’s Test

Moran’s I autocorrelation is used to identify clustering patterns in Lambeth. Unlike traditional point-pattern analysis, which requires specific household coordinates, Moran’s I is better suited for this analysis as it relies on the output areas provided in the data.

The study used Rook’s case and Queen’s case definition of Neighbors at the beginning. After comparing the average links and plotting Moran’s I local statistics map, results are found to be unrealistic in that some value exceeds +1 or -1. Therefore, both Rook’s case and Queen’s case are not applicable, and distance-based neighbourhood definition is adopted. By comparing Moran’s global statistics and p-value, the optimal distance threshold is set as 2000m. 

By setting the distance threshold as 2000m and the confidence level at 0.95, the Moran’s I global statistics return a Z-score of 2.8574 and a p-value of 0.0021, rejecting the null hypothesis that Lambeth is randomly clustered. Moran I statistics of 0.032 signifies a positive spatial autocorrelation, though the strength is relatively weak. A Local Indicators of Spatial Association map (LISA) is adopted to inform Lambeth Council that highlighted regions with clustering, warranting targeted policies and further investigation. 


Correlation: GWR
Geographically Weighted Regression is adopted to analyze the correlation between unemployment and educational attainments, allowing for comparison in a visualized map. An adaptive bandwidth is used to balance data density as it shrinks in denser areas and stretches in less populated areas, avoiding misleading results due to data skewness (Comber, 2023). The local R2 map shows a moderate explanatory power of educational attainments, ranging from 0.594 to 0.310. Mid-Lambeth shows stronger explanatory strength of educational attainments of 0.423 to 0.594, while upper-north and south Lambeth exhibits weaker explanatory power around 0.310 to 0.372. Initial educational rank distribution and its coefficient are selected to identify the regions with higher education deprivation coupling with high coefficients, signifying council that specific policy to implement.

```

Limitation:
Since unemployment data is formatted as OA units, converting to LSOA units requires manipulation of data, and this study simply computes the mean of various OAs into one LSOA unemployment value. Though it is reliable to convert from smaller to larger units, demonstrated by Norman (2012), it may incur biases as the mean can be greatly influenced by outliers in an LSOA unit. In addition, to explore unemployment’s relationship with educational attainments, the IMD2019 dataset is selected with census 2021. In recent years, the job environment has been detrimentally affected by COVID-19 (Tetlow, 2020), and the coefficient of educational attainment can be over-magnified. Education rank distribution adopts quantile classification, but as the Lambeth data is extracted from UK data, education rank is not in Lambeth order and may confuse interpretation. Future research is recommended to search for updated 2021 IMD LSOAs data and subset Lambeth data and causes of low-high and high-low regions should be further investigated to target relevant policies.


To conclude, every method is carefully selected to meet the requirements and address unique characteristics at spatial analysis.
